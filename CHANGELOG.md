## Fork

`crc-turbo` began as a fork of
[crc-fast](https://github.com/awesomized/crc-fast-rust) by Don MacAskill,
taken at its 1.10.0 release (`3a853cc`). crc-fast is a good library whose
maintainer has been inactive since that release: no merges or comments since
the start of 2026, and a backlog of outside pull requests - dependency
security bumps, `no_std` fixes, `digest` 0.11, a 256-bit x86 tier - waiting
without an answer. This crate exists so that work can ship. It is a hard
fork: it is not rebased onto crc-fast and is not kept in step with it, though
a fix that lands there is still welcome here. Every change taken from one of
crc-fast's open pull requests credits its author below and in the commit
that carries it. This section is the record of how the crate differs from
the release it was taken at, kept for readers who know crc-fast. crc-fast's
own changelog up to the fork point continues below, unchanged.

### Packaging

- Crate renamed to `crc-turbo`, library `crc_turbo`. The Rust module paths
  and the public API stay crc-fast 1.10.0's, so a consumer's migration is the
  dependency line plus `crc_fast::` → `crc_turbo::`.
- Version starts at `1.11.0`, one minor above the upstream base, to make the
  lineage obvious. The MSRV stays crc-fast's 1.89; development and CI use the
  toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- The C library's header is `libcrc_turbo.h`, its symbols are `crc_turbo_*`
  and its types `CrcTurbo*`. With crc-fast's names, a binary linking both
  crates under the default `ffi` feature would fail on duplicate symbols.
- Released by `.github/workflows/release.yml`, dispatched from the Actions tab
  on `main` (it creates the tag) or started by the signed `v<version>` tag
  `cargo xtask release` pushes; crates.io trusted publishing either way. See
  `docs/publishing.md`. Upstream's release workflow, which also built and
  attested binary packages of the C library and the CLI tools, is not
  carried; the `Makefile` builds and installs both from a checkout.
- Repository hygiene adopted from the scryer-media house style: SHA-pinned CI
  ending in a required `ci-complete` job that keeps all of upstream's lanes
  (aarch64, x86_64, 32-bit x86, the software fallback on big-endian PowerPC,
  Miri, `no_std`, WASM and a fuzz smoke of every target) and adds `clippy -D
  warnings` across feature sets, docs, MSRV and packaging; `security`
  (cargo-audit over both lockfiles, zizmor); `codeql`; gitleaks pre-commit
  hooks; renovate; issue templates; `AGENTS.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTORS.md`. Upstream's `tests.yml` and `release.yml` were removed
  as duplicates of these.
- The crate archive no longer carries the repository's CI, hook, fuzz and
  agent files, nor upstream's `.kiro/` design notes, which stay in the
  repository.

### Fixes taken from crc-fast's open pull requests

- `no_std` builds for x86_64 compile again: the AVX-512 tier imported
  `std::arch` rather than `core::arch` (crc-fast#57). From crc-fast#42 by
  netsbot; crc-fast#49 by onur-ozkan carries the same fix.
- A `crc-turbo` dependency is an ordinary Rust library again. The crate
  declared `cdylib` and `staticlib` crate types as well, which Cargo builds
  even for a dependency, and a `no_std` static library needs a panic handler
  the embedded application provides for itself. The C library, renamed
  `libcrc_turbo`, is now built by the unpublished `capi/` package; the
  Makefile builds and installs from there, and `make capi-test` runs a C smoke
  test against the static and the shared library. From crc-fast#49 by
  onur-ozkan, which dropped the extra crate types; the `capi/` package keeps
  the C library.

### x86_64 performance

- A new `x86_64-avx2-vpclmulqdq` tier for CPUs that have 256-bit VPCLMULQDQ
  but no AVX-512 (AMD Zen 3; Intel Alder Lake through Arrow Lake, where
  AVX-512 is fused off), which crc-fast runs on its 128-bit SSE tier. It
  holds the SSE tier's eight 128-bit fold streams in four YMM registers, so
  each carry-less multiply folds two streams, and byte-reverses forward
  (non-reflected) CRCs within each 128-bit lane, so no load needs a
  lane-crossing permute. It reuses the existing fold keys and reduction, so
  it covers every CRC-16, CRC-32 and CRC-64 algorithm in both bit orders;
  CRC-32/ISCSI keeps its SSE4.2 fusion path. AVX-512 CPUs keep their tiers.
  A test forces the tier on any CPU that has it and checks every algorithm
  against the table-driven implementation from unaligned starts and a
  carried state. VPCLMULQDQ is now detected on its own rather than only
  under AVX-512VL. dcbtsla proposed the same tier to crc-fast in
  crc-fast#56, independently and earlier; the feature-detection model here
  (VPCLMULQDQ and AVX2 as separate flags) is taken from it.
